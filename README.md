This project is a game that can be played both manually or by a neuroevolutionary algorithm. In this  game, there is an animal that tries to avoid obstacles and gain scores. Neuroevolutionary algorithm is used for this program. Evolution is used to create generations and go through the game and neural network is used to 
learn from mistakes and get the best possible score in the next generation.
